Lab: Cooperating classes
Purpose of this lab: To provide practise in building classes that need to cooperate.

Task 1
Identify the responsibilities of the class Name.

Name Class
Creating the Name Class

Task 2
Implement the Name class

Task 3
Once you have successfully compiled your name class you need to check out that it behaves as you expect.
To do this, create one or more instances of Name objects and systematically exercise their methods.
List the tests you carry out to validate Name.

Task 4
Once you are happy that Name is both syntactically and logically correct.
Add a copy of the Student class to the project. (A copy of Student is available on Blackboard).

Initially the type of name in Student is String, i.e.: Private String name;
Change it to be of type Name. You must then modify the rest of the code to reflect
the fact that the name attribute is no longer a String.

Task 5
Implement an ID class to model student IDs.

It must be a numeric string consisting of 8 digits. The first two digits are the year of entry into the University.
It is up to you to decide what services your class will provide, but at the very least is must be able to return
the full id and to return the year of entry.
